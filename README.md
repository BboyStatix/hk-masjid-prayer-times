It's a common phenomenon for people to enquire about the jamaat times of specific mosques in WhatsApp groups. Although there's already the [Athan+ app](https://mymasjidal.com/pages/athanplus) by [MasjidAl](https://mymasjidal.com/) for that, it's not very intuitive to ask every person who asks to download it. It would be much more convenient if one could directly paste a link which pops up a preview of the mosque's iqamah times.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
